const myInt = 5;

Operator	Name	Purpose	Example
+	Addition	Adds two numbers together.	6 + 9
-	Subtraction	Subtracts the right number from the left.	20 - 15
*	Multiplication	Multiplies two numbers together.	3 * 7
/	Division	Divides the left number by the right.	10 / 5
%	Remainder (sometimes called modulo)	
Returns the remainder left over 
after you've divided the left number into a 
number of integer portions equal to the right number.

8 % 3 (returns 2, as three goes into 8 twice, leaving 2 left over).

**	Exponent	Raises a base number to the exponent power, that is, the base number multiplied by itself, exponent times.	
5 ** 2 (returns 25, which is the same as 5 * 5).
